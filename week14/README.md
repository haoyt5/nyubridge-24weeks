## Agenda
Hopefully everyone is getting caught up with the Object Oriented material and the Doodlebug problem.  Unfortunately, there’s no time to take a break!  We’re moving on but, thankfully, with a bit of an easier topic.  This week, we have two topics at hand, searching and sorting.  The videos are up now and you should begin watching them.  As usual, we will discuss this topic (and I'm sure you'll have doodlebug questions) during our Thursday meeting!

For this week, please do the following:
- Read “Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis” by Mark Allen Weiss, chapters 2 and 7. (Much of chapter 2 is review, concentrate on items you’re not familiar with)
- Be able to answer all of the self-test exercises in the chapters
- Watch “Searching”, and “Sorting” videos. 
- Attend the weekly webinar (Thursday 8:00 Pm). 

## Assignment
(Weiss 7.40): The following divide-and-conquer algorithm is proposed for finding the simultaneous
maximum and minimum: If there is one item, it is the maximum and
minimum, and if there are two items, then compare them, and in one comparison
you can find the maximum and minimum. Otherwise, split the input into two
halves, divided as evenly as possibly (if N is odd, one of the two halves will have
one more element than the other). Recursively find the maximum and minimum
of each half, and then in two additional comparisons produce the maximum and
minimum for the entire problem.

Write the above function which will take in a vector and solve the problem, producing a vector of two elements, the min and max.
