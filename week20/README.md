## Assignments
The UNIX "Fork" command has been a critical aspect of network programming over the years.  I would like you to write a (roughly) one page summary of what the function does and what activities you'd expect to see in the operating system after calling this function from a program.  Please pay careful attention to the various states that a process goes through and explain which states you'd expect each process to be in and why.
