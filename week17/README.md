## Agenda
This week we will be continuing our study of data structures and concentrating on trees and tree traversals.  Trees is a rather large topic, so please allocate adequate time to review the material.

- View the videos on Trees
- Read all of chapter 4
- Read the Wikipedia article on Red-Black Trees, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree.
- Join the webinar (Thursday 8:00 pm), or view it on Thursday after the event.
- Play with these websites: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html  and  https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html
Remember the Third Midterm exam will be held on Thursday ** May 13th 6pm EST covering topics from Week 1-17, inclusive. **
## Objective


The data structures we’re discussing this week is Trees.  Ultimately, we’d like you to be able to understand who these fundamental data types work and are used in Computer Science.

At the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Understand what a Tree is
- Understand Binary search trees
- Understand tree traversals (Pre, Post, In order and level order)
- Be able to choose an appropriate data structure for a task.

## Assignment
In this assignment, you will complete the code for insertions in a Red-Black tree.  We've provided a framework with comments.  You should complete the sections labeled "TODO" 


You are also required to follow any directions accompanying comments such as "NOTE".
You can add/modify code anywhere, with the exception of the provided "main" (which we will use for testing).
You can use the constants RED and BLACK, instead of the ints 0 and 1, when appropriate.
